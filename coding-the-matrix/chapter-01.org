* Chapter 1 - The Field - Reading guide
This chapter introduces the reader to the concept of *fields*, which is larger class of numbers
then the real numbers that most readers are familar with. The operations are *plus* and *times*.
Each of which is closed within the field. 

The first few of sections introduce the complex numbers as a field. And, also shows that complex
numbers are have native support in Python through [[https://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/lexical_analysis.html#imaginary-literals][imaginary literals]]. Python's works with compex
numbers like any other numeric type. This is accomplished via operator overloading and object-oriented
programming. So, it's natural to use `+` or `*` and even mix and match complex and real operands. 

From the math point of view, as long as a set of numbers supports `+` and `*`, then its a field and
what is do in linear algebra works with any fields, not just real numbers.
